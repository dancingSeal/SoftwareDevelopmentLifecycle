How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
- Market research can be organized in a User Story Template. They can ranked by importance. The user stories should be compared to stakeholders requests. 

How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
- First decide which method should be used for the project. If the project needs flexibilty then agile could be a good fit. If the project set and will not waver then Waterfall Method would be a better fit. I will likely incorporate both of these practices in the future. 

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
- Trying the best you can and not leaving your team mates to do all the work.
